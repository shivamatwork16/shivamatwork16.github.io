### **📆 20 Feb 2025 - Status Report**
<!--more-->
### **🛠 Accomplishments**

- Successfully implemented **GET, PUT, and POST** methods for the `/api/surveys` endpoint, enhancing the survey management capabilities.
- Added the **average rating field** to the review model, providing more comprehensive data for analysis.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- **Conditional Question Logic:** While the core logic for conditional questions is in place, robust error handling and validation are needed to ensure `previous_question_id` references valid questions within the same survey. Clearer documentation is also required.
- **Performance Optimization:** The addition of conditional logic and population might impact the performance of GET endpoints (`/api/survey/:id` and `/api/surveys`), particularly for surveys with numerous questions.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Enhance the **conditional question logic** with robust validation and error handling, and improve documentation.
- Investigate and implement **performance optimizations** for GET endpoints to address potential bottlenecks.
- Begin **comprehensive testing** of API endpoints, including edge cases and conditional question flows.
