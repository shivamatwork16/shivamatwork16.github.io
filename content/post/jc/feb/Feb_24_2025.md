### **📆 24 Feb 2025 - Status Report**
<!--more-->
### **🛠 Accomplishments**

- Successfully developed the **model and endpoints** for posting review survey responses at `/api/survey/response`.
- Created **endpoints** for retrieving survey responses (`getSurveyResponse`) and survey response statistics (`getSurveyResponseStats`), including robust validations.
- Contributed to the **design** of the "create survey" form in the front-end, enhancing user experience.
- Added a crucial **"type" field** to the review widget settings, improving flexibility.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Faced significant challenges in designing an efficient **response model schema**.
- The newly developed **API endpoints** remain untested due to the absence of a corresponding front-end.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Conduct **thorough testing** of the `getSurveyResponse`, `postSurveyResponse`, and `getSurveyStats` API endpoints.
- **Battle test** the API endpoints to ensure their stability and performance under load.
- Contribute to the **design** of the "create survey" form, focusing on features like email sending and link generation.
