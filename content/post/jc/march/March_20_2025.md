### **📆 20 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Developed multiple services for the e-learning project:
    - **MySQL query executor service**: A helper to safely execute SQL queries.
    - **Query logger service**: Tracking executed queries, their AST, success/error status, raw queries, and executors.
- Developed a new **data management system** that bypasses model creation in the file system, enhancing robustness and production readiness.
- Implemented functionality to **work with raw SQL** and track the exact schema used for executing queries.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Working with **raw SQL**, managing dependencies, and understanding the **AST for various cases** proved to be very challenging.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Implement the **data import module**, enabling data import into any table within the system.
