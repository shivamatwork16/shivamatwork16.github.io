### **📆 21 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Enhanced the `ALTER TABLE` functionality, integrating the schema provided by MySQL to adhere to MySQL standards.
- Developed a dynamic import function that supports importing data from CSV and XLSX files.
- Thoroughly tested all APIs for correctness.
- Fixed bugs related to incorrect SQL parser settings.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Determining the best approach for handling unique-related fields during data import, especially how to track and enforce uniqueness constraints. While `NOT NULL` constraints can be managed with checks, handling `UNIQUE` constraints requires a more sophisticated solution.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Address the challenge of handling unique field constraints during data import.
- Discuss and define the allowed `ALTER TABLE` operations and their implementation.
