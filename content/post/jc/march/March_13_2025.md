## **Sequelize vs. Mongoose: A Brief Introduction**

**Sequelize** is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Node.js that supports relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. It provides a way to interact with these databases using JavaScript objects, abstracting away the complexities of SQL.

**Mongoose**, on the other hand, is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that works with MongoDB, a NoSQL database. It allows you to define schemas for your data and interact with MongoDB using JavaScript objects, simplifying data modeling and validation.

### **Basic Comparison Table**

| Feature           | Sequelize (MySQL)       | Mongoose (MongoDB)       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Database Type** | Relational (SQL)        | NoSQL (Document)         |
| **Data Modeling** | Tables, Rows, Columns   | Documents, Collections   |
| **Query Language** | SQL                     | MongoDB Query Language   |
| **Relationships** | Joins, Foreign Keys     | Embedded, Referenced     |
| **Schema** | Defined Tables & Types | Flexible/Schema-Based    |
| **Primary Use** | Relational Data         | Document-Based Data      |
| **Basic Query** | `Model.findAll()`       | `Model.find()`           |
| **Create Record** | `Model.create()`        | `Model.create()`         |
| **Update Record** | `Model.update()`        | `Model.updateOne()`      |
| **Delete Record** | `Model.destroy()`       | `Model.deleteOne()`      |
| **Transactions** | Supported               | Supported (with caveats) |
