### **📆 19 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Developed a **dynamic validation function** for the CSV parser, ensuring data integrity by validating data against database fields before insertion.
- Implemented a **dynamic table generation function** that creates new database tables from raw SQL and tracks their creation.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Understanding the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for SQL** proved difficult, and I am still working to fully grasp it to support foreign key relationships.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Enhance the **dynamic table generation function** to support the creation of an unlimited number of tables from SQL, addressing the current single-table limitation.
- Implement all **CRUD operations** for the dynamically generated tables.
- Tackle the challenging task of implementing the **ALTER operation** for these tables.

## 📖 **Project Highlights**

### 🛡️ **Dynamic CSV Validation**

- Implemented a dynamic validation function to ensure data integrity during CSV parsing and database insertion.
- Focused on validating data against database field types and constraints.

### 🛠️ **Dynamic Table Generation**

- Developed a function to dynamically create database tables from raw SQL, providing flexibility and automation.
- Implemented tracking of table creation for management and auditing.

### 🧩 **AST Understanding Challenge**

- Acknowledged the complexity of understanding the SQL Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), highlighting the need for further learning.
- Working to fully grasp AST to support foreign key relationships in dynamic table generation.

### 🚀 **Dynamic Table Management Goals**

- Aim to enhance the dynamic table generation function to support multiple table creation from SQL.
- Plan to implement all CRUD operations for dynamically generated tables.
- Prepare to tackle the complex task of implementing the ALTER operation, demonstrating ambition and problem-solving skills.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**

- **Database:** MySQL (Sequelize)
- **SQL Parsing:** Custom AST analysis (in progress)
- **Validation:** Dynamic function development
- **Data Import:** CSV, SQL
