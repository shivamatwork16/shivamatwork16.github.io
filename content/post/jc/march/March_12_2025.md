### **📆 12 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->

- Worked on the **dashboards project**.
- Implemented a new requirement for the "review invite email without POS" module, allowing emails to be sent at a **specified date/time or immediately**, rather than solely on the upload day.
- Modified the `reviewpagesetting` model to accommodate the new **scheduling feature**.
- Resolved bugs related to **duplicate file uploads**, ensuring the system now handles identical file hashes without errors.
- Collaborated with the **front-end developer** to integrate the updated functionality end-to-end.
- Created a **demo video and comprehensive documentation** detailing the new feature's workflow.
- Studied **MongoDB aggregation pipelines** and reviewed relevant code, continuing to improve my understanding.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- **Debugging date handling** from the front-end was challenging due to the date being received as a string without time information, requiring a custom solution.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Address any **issues that arise** in this or other assigned modules.
- Await **final testing and feedback** from Shivam Chauhan sir.
- Implement any **requested improvements**.
