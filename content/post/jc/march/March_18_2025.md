### **📆 18 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Introduced **Joi validation** into the e-learning project, specifically applying validation to the `add table` and `update table` APIs.
- Successfully implemented the **update table API**, handling various edge cases and ensuring real-time file system updates and dynamic synchronization.
- Developed a new **API for dynamic data import**, enabling data import from CSV and XLSX files. This API allows executing queries on any table with an ID, with the data being reflected in the database.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Determining the **best approach for validation** during model updates, particularly when dealing with potential discrepancies and ensuring accurate string matching.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Develop a **highly dynamic validation function** that can generate new validation functions on-the-fly. This function will ensure data integrity before database execution, guaranteeing accurate database updates. This is a complex task, but I am confident in my ability to achieve it.
