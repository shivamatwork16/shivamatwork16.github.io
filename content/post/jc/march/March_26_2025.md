### **📆 26 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Implemented new, fully controllable **query execution APIs** for both admins and users, providing granular control over permissions, table names, and query types.
    - Admins can execute `ALTER`, `UPDATE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE` queries on user-generated tables, and create any new tables.
    - Users have restricted access based on permissions.
- Fixed various issues in the **dynamic table creation and alteration APIs**, preventing server crashes due to invalid queries.
- Implemented handling for cases where **no columns match the provided field names**.
- Made the **query logger service completely asynchronous** to improve response times.
- Implemented **extensive error handling** at all layers of the query execution and syntax check APIs to prevent server stoppages.
- Provided a **Unit testing video link** for the user select api: [https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/38054224?key=1ae9f7599c518313780676a2111702ee](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/38054224?key=1ae9f7599c518313780676a2111702ee)

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- **Debugging the query execution and table manipulation logic** proved to be very challenging and time-consuming.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Prepare a **comprehensive presentation** explaining the implemented features, their usage, and potential improvements.
- **Demonstrate the functionality and capabilities** of the new query execution APIs.
