### **📆 17 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Implemented **user-generated models** within the codebase using file system functionalities.
- Successfully **synchronized** these models with Sequelize.
- Developed **API endpoints** for:
    - Adding new tables (reflected in the real file codebase).
    - Activating, deactivating, and deleting tables.
    - Setting up the complete flow for handling dynamic tables from scratch.
- Generated **Postman documentation** for all implemented API endpoints.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Determining the **optimal approach** for dynamically generating models within the file system and enabling hot reloading on the server.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Develop **API endpoints for editing user-generated models**.
- Ensure the **edit API** is production-ready.
