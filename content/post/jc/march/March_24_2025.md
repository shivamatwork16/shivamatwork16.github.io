### **📆 24 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
**E-learning Project:**

- Implemented handling for **unique table constraints** in the data import process, ensuring duplicate data from CSV/EXCELL is identified and excluded from SQL queries.
- Ensured **type matching** for all imported data and provided detailed response information.
- Added **statistics** to the data import API, as requested by the front-end team.
- Investigated and attempted to resolve issues with **null data not being reflected correctly**.

**Dashboard Project:**

- Implemented a `"type"` field in the review survey API to make it usable for both review invites and review surveys.
- Added an `"isocode"` projection to the response (minor enhancement).
- Started understanding the new requirements for managing the send functionality of the review survey API.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Handling **unique constraints** during data import, especially when dealing with duplicate data in CSV files, proved to be very challenging. I was able to find a solution.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Implement the review survey API based on the final client call.
- Gain a thorough understanding of the new requirements for the survey API.
