### **📆 25 Mar 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Developed a **modular service for user query execution** in the e-learning project.
- Fixed various **bugs in the data management API**, including syntax error handling that was causing codebase crashes.
- Implemented **MySQL connection pooling** to prevent query rejections due to connection failures.
- Created new `"select"` and `"admin execute"` APIs, providing privileged query execution for admins and restricted `"select"` access for users.
- Implemented a **whitelist service** that updates whitelist tables in real-time.
- Provided a **Unit Testing Video Link**: [https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/38007535?key=46ce0cac2d87fa2477354aaba751a7fb](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/38007535?key=46ce0cac2d87fa2477354aaba751a7fb)

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Managing **query permissions** and determining who can execute which queries proved to be a significant challenge.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Complete **unit testing** for the implemented services and APIs.
- Develop a plan for handling the **question module**.
