### **📆 23 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Achievements**
<!--more-->

- Implemented **smart context switching** for user-generated queries.
- Added **questions provided by the client**.
- Developed an **API to display all children and their descendants up to the nth level**, with a custom key `isLeaf`.
- Created an **encryption module** for data encryption.
- Started working on a **Postman script** for testing the encryption.
- Made **multiple code quality improvements** in the Trendex project.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Creating the **deeply nested function** was challenging, but it was successfully implemented.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- **Integrate the encryption module into the front-end**.
- Perform **unit tests on every module** to ensure the encryption module does not disrupt any existing application logic.

## 📖 **Project Highlights**

### 🧠 **Intelligent Query Context Switching**

- Implemented a smart mechanism to automatically determine and switch database contexts for user-generated SQL queries, enhancing the e-learning SQL integration.

### ❓ **Client-Provided Questions**

- Successfully integrated questions provided by the client into the relevant module, likely for quizzes or learning assessments.

### 🌳 **Deep Level Location Retrieval**

- Developed an API to efficiently retrieve all descendants of a location node up to a specified level, marking leaf nodes with the `isLeaf` key for simplified front-end rendering.

### 🔒 **Data Encryption Module**

- Created a dedicated module for encrypting sensitive data, enhancing the security posture of the application.

### 🧪 **Encryption Testing Setup**

- Began developing a Postman script to facilitate thorough testing of the newly implemented encryption module.

### ✨ **Trendex Code Refinement**

- Made significant improvements to the code quality within the Trendex project, enhancing maintainability and readability.

### ⚙️ **Complex Tree Traversal Solution**

- Overcame the challenge of implementing the deeply nested location retrieval function, demonstrating problem-solving skills.

### 🚀 **Tomorrow's Focus: Encryption Integration and Testing**

- Will prioritize integrating the encryption module into the front-end application.
- Will also conduct comprehensive unit tests across all modules to ensure the encryption implementation does not introduce any regressions or conflicts.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**

- **E-learning:** SQL integration, Database management (likely MySQL)
- **Location Management:** Tree-based data structures, API development
- **Security:** Encryption module
- **Testing:** Postman, Unit testing
- **Trendex:** Code quality improvements
