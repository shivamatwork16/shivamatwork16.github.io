### **📆 11 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Developed a new API to **generate a sample CSV file**.
- Fixed a bug that **prevented uploading the same file for different settings**.
- Resolved a **major bug in the dashboard related to file storage and retrieval**:
    - Implemented the use of a **timestamp to generate unique filenames** for uploaded customer data files. This ensures that each customer's data remains distinct and prevents overwriting issues that could lead to sending emails to the wrong customers.
- Fixed **bugs in the SMS API**.
- Created and parsed a **CSV file to ensure no mathematical values are present** in the CSV sample.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Setting the **default sample file** was challenging, but a successful solution has been implemented.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Begin **studying WhatsApp integration**.
