### **📆 14 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Developed a **default add template service**.
- Implemented a **"Send WhatsApp Message" function** to send messages via WhatsApp.
- Fixed a bug in the **reminder display**, ensuring it's correctly shown during the edit flow on the front end.
- Researched **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:
    - Explored its purpose and usage.
    - Reviewed **XML (Extensible Markup Language)** and its role in SOAP.
    - Studied **WSDL (Web Services Description Language)** and its importance for SOAP API usage, referencing [https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml\_wsdl.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_wsdl.asp).
- Provided **Unit testing video link** for the client issue on prod app: [https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/38719681?key=d012458a5b6f5f92628e6072a5b362ed](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/38719681?key=d012458a5b6f5f92628e6072a5b362ed)
- Investigated **fuzzy search capabilities in Mongoose with Node.js** and confirmed its feasibility.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Going through the code base to figure out how the **WhatsApp token is being handled** was challenging; in the end, I was able to solve it.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Implement the **WhatsApp review invite functionality in live**. There is no integration of the WhatsApp Meta API; we need to have that before we can proceed with review invite sharing on WhatsApp.

- Resolved a front-end bug that prevented reminders from displaying correctly during the edit flow.

### 📚 **SOAP Protocol Research**

- Conducted research on SOAP, XML, and WSDL, gaining foundational knowledge for potential integration with SOAP-based services.

### 🔍 **Fuzzy Search Exploration**

- Investigated the feasibility of implementing fuzzy search using Mongoose and Node.js, potentially enhancing search functionality.

### 🔑 **WhatsApp Token Discovery**

- Successfully navigated the codebase to understand how the WhatsApp token is managed, overcoming an initial challenge.

### 🚧 **WhatsApp Live Integration Dependency**

- Identified that the WhatsApp Meta API integration is a prerequisite for implementing live WhatsApp review invite functionality.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**

- **Backend APIs:** Node.js (Express)
- **Messaging:** WhatsApp (initial implementation), Email, SMS
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose - for fuzzy search exploration)
- **Web Services:** SOAP, XML, WSDL (research)
- **Frontend:** Bug fixing
