### **📆 21 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Imported a **model and its data** into the admin app.
- Fixed a bug in **review invite emails for the reservation system**, resolving the issue and enabling email sending.
- Fixed a bug in **sending SMS messages for standalone review invites**. The system now saves customers based on the presence of either a phone number or an email address, removing the previous requirement for an email address in the default SMS template.
- Developed a plan to use a **separate database namespace for SQL query integration in e-learning**. This will prevent errors caused by naming conflicts with existing tables.
- Started studying **Trendex**: its purpose, intended use, and objectives, in preparation for upcoming work.
- Fixed a bug in **Google review listing** that caused an "id undefined" error during the review process.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Determining the best method for **context switching between two database namespaces** was challenging. The solution implemented involves using two separate databases.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Develop **APIs for the Trendex project**, following the weekly plan.
- Implement **complete dual context switching** in the e-learning project.

## 📖 **Project Highlights**

### ⚙️ **Admin App Data Import**

- Successfully imported a model and its associated data into the administrative application.

### 📧 **Reservation System Email Fix**

- Resolved the bug preventing review invite emails from being sent through the reservation system, restoring expected functionality.

### 💬 **Flexible SMS Invite Logic**

- Fixed a bug in SMS sending, allowing customer saving and invite sending based on the presence of either a phone number or an email, improving flexibility.

### 🏛️ **E-learning Database Isolation**

- Developed a strategy to utilize a separate database namespace for SQL integration in the e-learning project, mitigating potential naming conflicts.

### 📚 **Trendex Project Onboarding**

- Began studying Trendex, understanding its core purpose and intended applications, in preparation for development tasks.

### ✨ **Google Review Listing Stability**

- Fixed a bug causing an "id undefined" error in the Google review listing process, ensuring smoother review handling.

### 🔀 **Database Context Switching Challenge**

- Navigated the complexities of switching between database contexts, implementing a solution using two distinct databases.

### 🚀 **Tomorrow's Focus**

- Will prioritize developing APIs for the Trendex project according to the established weekly plan.
- Will also focus on implementing a complete dual context switching mechanism within the e-learning project.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**

- **Admin App:** (Specific technologies not detailed)
- **Review Invites:** Email, SMS
- **E-learning:** SQL integration, Database management (likely MySQL)
- **Google Reviews:** API integration
- **Database:** (Likely MongoDB for the main application, with plans for a separate namespace for SQL in e-learning)
- **Trendex:** (Technologies to be determined during development)
