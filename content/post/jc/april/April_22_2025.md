### **📆 22 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Achievements**

<!--more-->
- Fixed bugs in the **review invite based on the company reservation system**. The bugs fixed are as follows:
    - The mail was sent to the orders which were **not even confirmed**.
    - The **setting was not getting updated**; previous settings were shown to the new mail recipient.
- Started working on the **Trendex API**, attended the client call, and understood the requirements.
- Prepared a **module for managing tree-based location CRUD**.
- Implemented **dual context switching for MySQL**.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Handling the **storage of deeply nested addresses** was challenging.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Implement **smart dual database context switching** in the e-learning project.
- Create a function to print all possible children during the showcase with a custom key `isLeaf`, to simplify front-end development.

## 📖 **Project Highlights**

### 📧 **Reservation System Review Invite Fixes**

- Addressed critical bugs in the review invite system for company reservations, ensuring emails are only sent for confirmed orders and that the correct settings are applied.

### 🚀 **Trendex API Initiation**

- Began development on the Trendex API after attending the client call and gaining a clear understanding of the project requirements.

### 🗺️ **Tree-Based Location Management**

- Developed a module to handle CRUD operations for location data organized in a tree structure, likely for hierarchical data representation.

### 🔀 **MySQL Dual Context Switching**

- Successfully implemented the ability to switch between two database contexts within MySQL, a crucial step for the e-learning project's SQL integration.

### 🌳 **Nested Address Storage Challenge**

- Encountered difficulties in efficiently and effectively storing deeply nested address information, requiring careful consideration of database schema and querying strategies.

### 🧠 **Smart Context Switching (Tomorrow)**

- Planned to implement a more intelligent dual database context switching mechanism in the e-learning project, potentially involving automated context determination.

### ⚙️ **Simplified Front-End Tree Traversal (Tomorrow)**

- Aimed to create a utility function to easily traverse the location tree and identify leaf nodes using a custom `isLeaf` key, simplifying front-end development for showcasing location data.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**

- **Review Invites:** Email, Reservation System Integration
- **Trendex:** API Development (technologies to be determined)
- **Location Management:** Tree-based data structures, CRUD operations
- **Database:** MySQL (Dual Context Switching)
- **E-learning:** SQL Integration

## 🚀 **What’s Next?**

- Implement smart dual database context switching in the e-learning project.
- Develop the tree traversal function with the `isLeaf` key.
- Continue building APIs for the Trendex project.
