### **📆 07 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Made the **survey sharing based on order production ready**. Now, when a date is selected, messages are sent to real users.
- **Bug reports, fixes, and updates are live in production:**
    - **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling for edit invoice requests, ensuring proper resolution (success or failure). Previously, errors caused infinite loading.
    - **Data Extraction:** Corrected payload data extraction to accurately capture all necessary information for invoice generation, maintaining data integrity.
    - **Invoice Download Function:** Fixed to correctly handle single and multiple breakdowns, ensuring accurate HTML output.
    - **PDF Generation & File Upload:** Confirmed to be working as designed, requiring no further modifications.
- Started reading about the **web hook API**.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Debugging the **Edit Invoice functionality was very challenging** but was successfully resolved.
- A bug in the **edit invoice functionality the values get lost when we save yet to be fixed**.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Work on the **custom field mapping functionality in the web hook**. On web hook receipt, the system should check for custom field mapping settings. If a map exists, update the corresponding orders in our system and the system that initiated the web hook call.
- **Fix the bug in the invoice detail edit API**.
