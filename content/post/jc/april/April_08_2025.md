### **📆 08 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
- Developed an **event-driven analytics system** that saves each unique event, tracking the channel (WhatsApp, email, SMS, and others).
- Created a **context-aware aggregation pipeline** to generate a time series of analytics data.
- The API provides statistics for:
  ```json
  {
    "date": "2025-04-08",
    "sent_email": 1000,
    "sent_whatsapp": 7543,
    "sent_sms": 507,
    "sent_other": 0,
    "sent_total": 9050,
    "impressions_email": 1,
    "impressions_whatsapp": 1,
    "impressions_sms": 1,
    "impressions_other": 0,
    "impressions_total": 3,
    "responses_email": 1,
    "responses_whatsapp": 1,
    "responses_sms": 1,
    "responses_other": 0,
    "responses_total": 3,
    "avgRating": 3
  }
  ```
- Developed a **centralized overall stats feature**, providing time-independent, lifetime statistics.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Emitting and handling events correctly was challenging but successfully resolved.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Improve the **response keys**.
- Include **distributed average rating** and **distributed response rate**.
- **Track sent events** and set the channel in the review link.
