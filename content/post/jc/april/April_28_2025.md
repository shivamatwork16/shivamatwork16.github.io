### **📆 28 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Achievements**
<!--more-->

**Project Dashboards:**

- Prepared a **rules document for the review invite email**.
- Made our function **compliant with the rule document**.
- Added **confirm order status check** for the review invite email reminder (previously it was absent).

**Project Trendex:**

- Added **Image, description, and company associations** in the location module.
- Implemented a **brand new API which is capable of recursively searching for the location or sub-location or sub-sub location along with the description of the place**.
- Added **role-based checks for the owner and the company** and more security features.
- Provided **convenient functions to the front-end team to implement the encryption module**.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Implementing the **recursive search** was challenging but was eventually tackled.

### **🎯 Tomorrow's goals:**

- Implement **caching based on the location** to decrease the response time of search (currently slow due to the need to form the complete tree).

## 📖 **Project Highlights**

### 📧 **Enhanced Review Invite Emails (Dashboards)**

- Developed a comprehensive rule document for review invite emails, ensuring consistent and effective communication.
- Aligned the email sending function with the established rules.
- Implemented a check for confirmed order status before sending review invite email reminders, preventing premature emails.

### 📍 **Improved Location Module (Trendex)**

- Enriched the location module with image, description, and company association capabilities.
- Created a powerful recursive search API for locations and their descendants, including descriptions.
- Enhanced security with role-based access control for owners and companies.
- Provided user-friendly functions to the front-end team to facilitate encryption integration.

### 🔍 **Recursive Search Implementation Challenge**

- Successfully overcame the complexities of implementing a recursive search function for location data.

### ⏱️ **Caching for Performance (Tomorrow)**

- Planned to implement caching mechanisms to improve the response time of location searches, which is currently slow due to the need to build the entire location tree.

### 🛠️ **Tech Stack Used**

- **Dashboards:** Review invite emails, Rule-based systems
- **Trendex:** Location management, Recursive search, Security, Encryption
- **Caching:** (To be implemented)

## 🚀 **What’s Next?**

- Implement caching for the location search API.
