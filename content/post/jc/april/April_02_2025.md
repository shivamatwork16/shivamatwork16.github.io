### **📆 02 Apr 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Accomplishments**

<!--more-->
**E-learning Project:**

- Worked on **SQL user and admin execute services**.
- Prepared a `"total attempt"` key.
- Modified the **query listing API** to display current data at the top.
- Started developing the **question solver module** with answer matching (using `JSON.stringify` for comparison).
- Removed **password** from the user listing API.

**Dashboard Project:**

- Worked on the **survey module**, adding more keys to the response stats.
- Implemented stats for **total sent, total responses, and response rate**, which required code modifications.

### **⚠️ Challenges Faced**

- Developing the **question module**, specifically how to accurately match answers, was challenging. The solution implemented was to use `JSON.stringify` and then compare the strings.

### **🎯 Goals for Tomorrow**

- Work on the **survey send module** to simplify and test its survey sharing functionality and make it more robust.
- Work on the **e-learning data module** and its related APIs.
