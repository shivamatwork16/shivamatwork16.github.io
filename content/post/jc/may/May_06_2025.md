### **📆 06 May 2025 - Status Report**

### **🛠 Achievements**
<!--more-->

**Project Trendex:**

- Fixed **all the issues which were coming due to the database migration implementation**. There were various key problems fixed, tested, and ensured that no such problems exist due to the migration.
- Generated **models for the report** and prepared a detailed schema for report creation, considering the values to be received from the form based on the client's provided sheet.
- Provided **APIs to the front-end team for creating and working with references** with more granular support for automated lookups.
- Implemented **various miscellaneous fixes** reported by the front-end team according to their preferences.

### **⚠️ Challenges:**

- Deciding on the **number of models to be created was challenging**. In the end, we concluded that we would generate as many models as required and only save an array of simple items in cases involving multiple IDs.

### **🎯 Tomorrow's Goals:**

- Implement **all the models required to generate a comprehensive report** as specified by the client, meeting all the standards and regulations.
